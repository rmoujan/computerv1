Polynomial Equation Solver
This project is a simple C++ program designed to solve polynomial equations up to degree 2. It takes user input for coefficients and exponents, evaluates the equation, and outputs the solution(s) step by step.

Features:
Supports linear (𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏 = 0 ax + b = 0) and quadratic and quadratic ( 𝑎 * X ^ 2 + 𝑏 * X + 𝑐 = 0) equations.
Handles real solutions using algebraic methods.
Displays the equation and detailed solution process.
This project is part of a series aimed at rekindling mathematical concepts through programming. It demonstrates problem-solving and logic implementation in C++.
