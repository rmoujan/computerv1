you should calcul delta
delta > 0 ---> give us two solutions
delta == 0 --->give us one solution
delta < 0 --->does not have solution

**DEfinition :
A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (also called indeterminates),
coefficients, and exponents that are non-negative integers. 
**General Form of a polynomial:
P(x) = ax^(n) + bx^(n-1) + cx^(n - 2) ... 

** constraintes :
1- Write a program that solves a polynomial second or lower degree equation.
2- Every term respect the form (a âˆ— x^p)
3-  I dont get very well this : (You should also think of zero, negative or non whole coefficients)
==>means mo3amil y9de yekon zero wela negative number wela 3adad ghayr sa7i7 (b7al kosor , jodor, 3adad 3ashari)



// the expected format : "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0"


1-split by equal =
2- split by space (addih)
