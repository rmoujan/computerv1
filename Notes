you should calcul delta
delta > 0 ---> give us two solutions
delta == 0 --->give us one solution
delta < 0 --->does not have solution

**DEfinition :
A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (also called indeterminates),
coefficients, and exponents that are non-negative integers. 
**General Form of a polynomial:
P(x) = ax^(n) + bx^(n-1) + cx^(n - 2) ... 

** constraintes :
1- Write a program that solves a polynomial second or lower degree equation.
2- Every term respect the form (a âˆ— x^p)
3-  I dont get very well this : (You should also think of zero, negative or non whole coefficients)

// the expected format : "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0"


1-split by equal =
2- split by space (addih)

// output the left and right sides of equation :
 "7*X^2 + 3*X^1 + 1*X^3 - 6*X^2 + 8 * X = 7*X^0 - 7*X^3 + 8"
OUTPUT THE Left VECTOR WITH KEY/VALUE

{7, X^2}
{3, X^1}
{1, X^3}
{6, X^2}
{8, X}
OUTPUT THE Right VECTOR WITH KEY/VALUE 
{7, X^0}
{7, X^3}
{8, }

**steps needed :
//declare an array of chars  and fill it with the last char in each vector.
//wash n filli array of chars then nshof wash sorted or not
//yes bash t cheki ta right side and pick the greates one.
//and save the greates in the degree
weslt hena :
//then switch the right to left (with calcul and pay attention to sign)
//make the reduced form
//calcul delta
//handle exceptions.
